During my time at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://www.allenai.org) I was a research scientist, manager, and lead of the AI2-THOR team.
My recent research interests have focused on training robotic systems in simulation that seamlessly transfer to the real world.
I am broadly interested in intelligent agents that can act in complex environments,
e.g. to write code or play games, especially when these agents can learn from visual interaction.
I recieved my PhD in statistics from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) advised by
[Mathias Drton](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/drton-mathias). My undergraduate years were spent at
[UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) where I graduated as the valedictorian in Mathematics.
