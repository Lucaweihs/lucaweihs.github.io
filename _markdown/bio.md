I am a research scientist, manager, and lead of the AI2-THOR team at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://www.allenai.org). My recent research interests focus on training robotic systems in simulation that seamlessly transfer to the real world. I am also broadly interested in intelligent agents that can act in complex environments, e.g. to write code or play games, especially when these agents can learn from visual interaction. I recieved my PhD in statistics from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) advised by [Mathias Drton](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/drton-mathias). My undergraduate years were spent at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) where I graduated as the valedictorian in Mathematics.
